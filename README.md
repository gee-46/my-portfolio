## 🎬 How It Works

The portfolio uses a sophisticated scroll-driven animation system:

1. **Frame Loading** — Image frames are loaded from `/public/sequence/`
2. **Scroll Tracking** — Scroll progress is tracked using Framer Motion
3. **Frame Mapping** — Scroll position is mapped to a frame index
4. **Canvas Rendering** — Frames are rendered on an HTML5 Canvas
5. **Content Animation** — Overlay content animates in sync with scroll

This produces a cinematic storytelling experience similar to premium product sites like Apple and Nike.
